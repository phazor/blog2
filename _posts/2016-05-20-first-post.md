## First Post

I'm creating this blog because I have a few things that are bursting to be written down. If all goes well, these will make it onto the web over the next few months.

The first real post should be easy. I'm currently travelling around SEA so I'll likely write about my attempts at development without a laptop. 

Who knows after that ðŸ˜‰.
